    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rheinischer Sauerbraten is a roast made from a meat marinade with vinegar, water, vegetable broth and spices left for several days. The resulting marinade tenderizes the meat little by little.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef: Start with a 3-pound beef rump roast. </li>
        <li>Onions: Two chopped onions lend bold flavor. </li>
        <li>Red wine vinegar: Red wine vinegar adds tang and helps tenderize the meat.</li>
        <li>Water: Youâ€™ll need a cup of water for the marinade. </li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the marinade with salt, black pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour ensures perfectly browned meat.</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the red wine, red wine vinegar, onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chuck roast to the pot and bring to a boil again. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour, or until the roast is browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Remove the roast from the pot and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Pour the marinade into a large bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>When the roast is cool enough to handle, trim any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Place the roast in a large baking dish and pour the marinade over it.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and refrigerate for at least 3 days, or up to 1 week</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove the roast from the marinade and discard the marinade.</li>
        <li>Place the roast in a roasting pan and roast for 2-2 1/2 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove the roast from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing</li>
        <li>Serve with the pan juices.</li>
    </ol>
